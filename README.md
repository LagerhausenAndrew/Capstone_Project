## Final Thoughts

 Thank you for taking the time to read from/use my capstone project. This was an incredible test of my skills gain over the last 12 weeks.

 I was able to get where I am at in this capstone project with the help of the instructors and classmates. I also referenced some labs/homework when I wasn't quite remembering how to do something.
