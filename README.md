# Project 4 Capstone Project

## Project Description
This capstone project is going to be an E-Commerce website. I have a small side gig of doing woodworking, and when starting this web-dev class I thought it would be incredibly cool to build my very own website for it. 

## MVP
* Create a React-App for my E-Commerce Woodworking site.
* Create Links/Routes to navigate my webpage.
    * Have a products view page
    * Link to submit questions/comments
* Create auth (for login features)
* Create a shopping cart feature
    * Allow logged in users to add items to their cart.
    * Upon 'Checkout' allow users to submit their 'order' to my email & send the user a confirmation email.
* Add a syling library
* Add a backend database
    * Auth/Login
    * Products
    * Individuals shopping carts

## Stretch Goals
* Add a backend database
    * Add reviews for products
    * Add reviews for the creator
    * Add the ability to keep track of stock...
* Have a submit questions button that will send an email to myself.
* Add a Like button that allows users to upvote a product.
* Have a file uploader on the contact sheet for people to upload designs they would like to see if I could make
